/**
 * The Supabase Storage client, spoken to over its S3-compatible protocol rather than
 * `@supabase/supabase-js`'s storage helper. Supabase exposes every bucket at
 * `<project>/storage/v1/s3`, so the AWS S3 SDK talks to it directly — which means the presigned
 * upload path, the `sharp` derivative pipeline and the key convention below are all the real
 * thing, unchanged from when this project ran on Cloudflare R2, instead of a second parallel
 * implementation. Only the endpoint, credentials and public base URL differ per environment.
 *
 * Deliberately has no `import "server-only"` of its own — it's consumed two ways:
 *   - lib/storage/storage.ts re-exports it WITH the server-only guard, for use from the Next.js
 *     app (server actions, route handlers) where accidental client-bundle inclusion must
 *     hard-fail.
 *   - scripts/migrate-images.ts imports this file directly, since standalone tsx/Node scripts
 *     have no "react-server" bundler condition and the `server-only` package throws
 *     unconditionally outside of it (see lib/db/script-client.ts for the same pattern on the DB
 *     side).
 * Never import this file from app/ or components/ — use lib/storage/storage.ts there instead.
