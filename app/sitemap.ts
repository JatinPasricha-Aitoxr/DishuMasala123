/**
 * The sitemap, built from the database rather than a static list (CLAUDE.md §10). A generated
 * file would go stale the moment staff publish a product or a post in the admin — which is
 * exactly the thing the admin exists to let them do — so it is derived at request time from the
 * same queries the pages themselves use.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded: `/account/*`, `/admin/*` and `/checkout` (private or transactional),
 * `/order/*` (per-order, signed URLs), `/search` (infinite query space), and `/design-system`
 * (an internal reference page). `app/robots.ts` disallows the same set, so the two agree.
